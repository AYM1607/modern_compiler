# modern-compiler

My attempt of going through the book "modern compiler implementation in ML"

This is my first time doing a serious project in a functional style language,
likewise, this is my first time working with StandardML so my code may
not be idiomatic.

Any code pushed will be tested at least against the examples given in the book.
Code will not be tested with any other version/distribution other than the one 
I used, which is SML/NJ 110.99.3
