# modern-compiler

My attempt of going through the book "modern compiler implementation in ML"

I started writing the code in Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) but I quickly realized
that the outdated tooling and the lack of a dependable language server would greatly
impact my productivity. I can appreciate the exercise of doing development without
the aid of modern developer tools. However, I'd like to focus on learning compiler concepts
rather than fight the tool that I'm using to implement them. In my short experience with both
SML and OCaml, I'd say that I like SML a bit more but I'll compromise and give the edge to
OCaml for the reasons explained above.

This is my first time doing a serious project in a functional style language,
likewise, this is my first time working with OCaml so my code may
not be idiomatic.

Any code pushed will be tested at least against the examples given in the book.
Code will not be tested with any other version/distribution other than the one 
I used, which is OCaml 4.13.1
